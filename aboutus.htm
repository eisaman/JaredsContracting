        <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Jared Isaman. I am a Captain for the City of Olean Fire Department where I have been employed since 2003. I have been married to my wife, Erin, since 2002 and we have 4 children; Elena (18), Ben(16), Natalie(14), and Addison(12). We also have 2 dogs; Ruby and Lexi. I have always had a passion for construction, so I founded Jared's Contracting in 2007. I run the business by myself with the occasional help of my son, Ben.</p>
